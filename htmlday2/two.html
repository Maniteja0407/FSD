    <h1><u>Super Bowl win sees Mailata complete</u> 'greatest story in football'</h1>
    <div style="display:flex;">
        
    <div style="width: 30%;"><h2><span style="font-size: 40px;color:blue;">T</span>he Philadelphia Eagles were still celebrating as Jordan Mailata headed into a media room deep inside the Superdome.</h2>
    <p>As the hulking offensive lineman lumbered on to a chair, one of his compatriots draped an Australian flag around his shoulders.

     <br>   The Kansas City Chiefs were hoping to become the first team to win three straight Super Bowls in New Orleans.</p>
     <p>Instead it was Mailata who made NFL history. He grew up playing rugby league and had not played a single snap when the Eagles drafted him in 2018.

       <br> Now he has played in two Super Bowls and this time he became the first Australian to lift the Vince Lombardi Trophy.<br>
        
        <br>It was the latest chapter in what his mentor this week called "the greatest story in football".</p>
